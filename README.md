# Project Version Auto Updater

## About
This plugin enables automatic updates to the project version, using GitVersion. Other versioning schemes are considered, but I started with my own use-case. It was initally inspired by [GodotVersion](https://github.com/Gregorein/GodotVersion) by [Gregorein](https://github.com/Gregorein).

## How it works

## Getting Started

## Usage and derivative work
This plugin was initially inspired by [GodotVersion](https://github.com/Gregorein/GodotVersion) by [Gregorein](https://github.com/Gregorein). It is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE). It is released as it is, and you are free to do whatever you want. Issues and PR's are welcome, but I reserve the right to handle them at my own discretion. Attribution on derivative work would be nice, but not required. 

Be kind and make stuff.
